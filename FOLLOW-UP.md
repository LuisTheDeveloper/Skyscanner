# Implementation:

The librarires added are: mui, moment and styled-components.

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would add a beter UI for desktop screens, so that the page could be fully responsive. 
I would add functionality to the select button, where more details could be seen for the flight.
I would add weather conditions in the destinantion, by fetching data from weather API.
With more time I would also added some unit tests.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
All of it, was an interesting challenge!

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I spend most of my time in two parts: creating the date time calculation and also in styling the pieces of the elements in the card.
The mos difficult was creating a bullet-prood date time difference calculation withou relying on external libraries.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
I really enjoyed the test!
I would add some kind of functionality to that Select button to improve the test.
